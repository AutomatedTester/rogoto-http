Welcome to Rogoto HTTP's documentation!
=======================================

Rogoto is a project that will allow children to learn how to do development
without actually learning how to program. The idea is to use drawing pictures
by telling a robot what to do. If you grew up in the 80s and early 90s there is
a chance that you played with a `Logo Turtle`_.

This uses the `Logo Programming`_ language and allows people to draw what ever
they want using a very simplified syntax. E.g. ::
    pendown
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    right 90
    forward 10
    penup
