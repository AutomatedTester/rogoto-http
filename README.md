# rogoto-http


A Web Server that allows us to upload and interact with Rogoto. Someone can connect
to the webserver and then type in the commands and see what will happen on a canvas
and on the robot as it draws on paper.

2. run `pip install -r requirements`
3. Install node.js, this is required for javascript packages
4. run `npm install browserify -g`
